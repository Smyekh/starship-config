## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup in Seconds

### 1. Clone the Repository

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/Smyekh/starship-config.git ~/starship-config 
```

This will create the following directory structure:

```shell
~/starship-config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ starship_devforge.toml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ starship_forestglow.toml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ starship_grindmode.toml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ starship_sugarshell.toml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ starship_zoomies.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ use_starship.sh
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ themes/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ starship_devforge.meta
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other theme metadata)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.sh
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### 2. Run the Setup Script

Navigate to the cloned directory and run the setup script to automatically configure your shell (`.zshrc` or `.bashrc`).

```zsh
cd ~/starship-config
chmod +x setup.sh  # Make the script executable
./setup.sh
```

This script will:

* Detect your shell (`bash` or `zsh`)

* Append the necessary sourcing logic to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`

* Allow you to start using use_starship commands immediately

If you're using another shell, it‚Äôll show you what to add manually.

### 3. Reload Your Shell

To apply the changes, either restart your terminal or run:

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

This ensures the new configurations are loaded and ready to use.

## üöÄ Usage

Once setup is complete, you can easily switch between Starship configs from anywhere in your terminal.

```zsh
# Switch to a specific theme by name or alias
use_starship grindmode  # or use_starship gr
use_starship forestglow # or use_starship fo

# List all available themes
use_starship list

# Revert to Starship's default config
use_starship default

# Restore the last custom theme you were using
use_starship restore

# Get help
use_starship help
```

You can use these anywhere in your terminal ‚Äî no need to specify full paths.

> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note
>
> This script works by replacing the contents of your main ~/.config/starship.toml file with the theme you select. Any custom changes you make directly to ~/.config/starship.toml will be lost when you switch themes. To make permanent changes, edit the theme files in ~/starship-config/config/ instead.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customizing a Theme

Want to tweak a theme? Edit the .toml files directly within the ~/starship-config/config/ directory.

```zsh
# Open the theme you want to edit in your favorite editor
code ~/starship-config/config/starship_grindmode.toml
```

After saving your changes, simply apply the theme again with use_starship grindmode to see your updates.

Refer to the official Starship Configuration [Docs](https://starship.rs/config/) for all available modules and options.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

* [Starship] (https://starship.rs/guide/#%F0%9F%9A%80-installation) must be installed.

* A [Nerd Font] (https://www.nerdfonts.com/) is required to display icons correctly.

* The setup script officially supports bash and zsh. For other shells, you will need to manually source the `~/starship-config/scripts/use_starship.sh` script in your shell's configuration file.
